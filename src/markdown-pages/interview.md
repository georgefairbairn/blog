So the hours spent editing your CV, writing out your unique applications and filling in forms have paid off and you’ve finally been offered the prized interview. You’ve probably spent the week before doing all the necessary research and practising what type of biscuit you’d be, but how much thought have you given to your outfit?
First impressions are one of the most important parts of an interview. Some studies suggest that people make up their minds within the first ten seconds, and if you haven’t even had a chance to introduce yourself, your outfit is going to do that for you. 
There are three crucial factors you need to consider when choosing what to wear to an interview. 

1. Who is interviewing you? 
2. What role are you applying for? 
3. What type of interview is it? 

Let’s start with the first. This question means two things in itself: who, as in which person or people (the main boss, the current person in the position you’re applying for) will be interviewing you. This should not make a huge difference, as you should still keep things formal, but it gives you a starting point when deciding what outfit to choose. 
Try googling your interviewer to find a photo – if they’re not particularly well-known or famous they may still have an image on the company website or if they have a linkedin or twitter page. Chances are they will only use professional photos and you can use it as a chance to see what they’re wearing to imitate it. After all, if they’re wearing a black pencil skirt with a bright pink top on, they probably won’t be criticising you for choosing the same. 

The second type of ‘who’ refers to the company/organisation/business/brand you are applying to. The best way of covering this is to extensively research the company you are applying for. That may seem like the obvious thing to do before an interview anyway, but make sure you’re not just passively reading about the company, you’re actually thinking about it from a what-to-wear viewpoint. 

For example, if you’re applying to a creative advertising or marketing agency and their website is extremely formal, you might want to keep things slick and traditional. If it’s a modelling agency, do most of their models appear clean shaven or rugged and hairy? If it’s the latter, then make sure you let your hair grow a week in advance – consider appearance as well as outfits. You’ll be surprised at how much you find out through research – Abercrombie and Fitch for example don’t produce any purple or black clothes, so you might want to think twice about wearing either of those colours. 

Secondly, think about the role you’re applying for. Just putting on your best black suit isn’t always the answer. You need to think about what the position or role means. If you’re applying for a position as Head Buyer for Topshop still keep things formal but look at which formal clothes, colours and styles are currently in fashion. If you’re applying for a role in fashion, they’re almost certainly going to ask you about your outfit, and if not they’ll be making a mental note of what you’re wearing anyway. On the other hand, if you’re applying for a role as an artist it might be worth wearing the least formal clothes you own to ‘look the part’ – old paint splattered overalls are going to be much more convincing than an awkward suit. 

Finally, what type of interview is it? An informal chat? A group activity? Or the last stage of a very long process of other interviews? This might only relate to the finer details of your outfit – for guys it might be the decider between wearing a tie or an open collared shirt, or for women choosing between hair up or down. But it could also play a crucial part in determining what you wear. If it’s a group participation interview at somewhere like the Early Learning Centre or a sports club, you going to want to opt for loose active clothes, because a suit is not going to work in that environment. 

To finish, ask people for advice. Get friends, family and colleagues to give their opinion on your outfit, because despite all the research you may have done to plan your outfit, if it looks awkward or uncharacteristic on you, it’s going to give the interviewers a worse impression than if you wear something that generally suits you.
