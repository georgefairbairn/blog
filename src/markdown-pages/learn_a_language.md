If you’re not entirely convinced about learning a language, here are some of the reasons why it can not only be fun, but crucial for getting a job and earning money. Once you’ve decided to learn a language, sort out your plan of action as soon as possible as many options are available whilst you’re at university, so you want to make sure you’re prepared before term starts again. Below are a variety of some of the best and easiest ways to learn a language, so you can find the option that works best for you. 

___

_Local Adult Education Courses_

___

Most local borough councils offer adult education courses – and languages are usually a permanent fixture on their schedules. Wherever your university is, search for the local boroughs courses so that you can do an evening or weekend course whilst you’re at uni. Prices vary, but some councils offer discounted prices for low income households or students so you may be able to get it extremely cheaply. If your council doesn’t run courses, check local churches, charity shops or newsagents which have notice boards as often language teachers will advertise their classes there.

_Take a language module as part of your degree_

___

Many universities allow or even require that you take a unit or module outside of your main degree - so you won’t even have to learn a language on top of your degree work. Again, languages are always on offer, and in your first year there are usually a variety of beginner’s courses from French to Russian so if you didn’t study it at school, it won’t be a problem. However, if this is an option you want to consider, double check with your subject before term starts as open units are not always available to some subjects. 

___

_Self-teach_

___

This may sound like a lot of effort and hard work, but teaching yourself has never been easier and more relaxed. Companies such as Rosetta Stone provide computer language software which uses images, text, sound, and video to teach words and grammar. So if you find you have a free evening or want a break from uni work, you can teach yourself from the comfort of your bed. However, with most complete language courses costing around £240, you might want to consider putting it on your Christmas or birthday wish list.  Instead, you could buy some cheap course activity books from Amazon and eBay which you can carry around with you so that if you have some free time you can do some quick written exercises. 

___

_Join your university language society_

___

This option should really be done with one of the three options above as most language societies at uni don’t actually offer tuition. However, they are an ideal place to improve and build on your language skills as they offer a variety of activities from foreign language films to trips abroad to the country of your chosen language. It’s also a great chance to practise your language as most members of the society will probably be able to speak the language to some extent. Above all, language societies are a great social place to meet new friends and make your language more fun.  

___

_Go abroad_

___

Many countries offer language courses in the country where your chosen language is spoken. The summer break is an ideal chance to go abroad for a month or more to learn, whilst also getting a tan. The benefits? Learning a language in the country where it’s spoken is the best way to learn, as you are constantly putting into practise what you have just learnt which will make the process a lot quicker and easier. It’s also a fun chance to travel and live in another country for a short space of time – and the more you learn the language, the more you’ll start to fit in and feel like a local.
