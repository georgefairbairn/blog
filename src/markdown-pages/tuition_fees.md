I sit sipping my coffee listening to my friend as she lectures me for being boring. “God, when I was in first year I don’t think I ever made half my lectures each week. We were out 4 times a week so I could never be bothered to get up the next day”.

By contrast, I was pushing it if I was out twice a week, and on those occasions I was always consumed with the feeling of guilt and no matter how hungover or tired I felt, I would force myself, red bull in hand, to make the 30 minute journey into uni to attend my lectures. 

Now, this is not a glory-hunting chance to display my superior commitment to my degree – the crucial difference between myself and my friends in the year above is simple; it’s a financial difference of £16,605. The difference between our debt is greater than their overall debt will be at the end of their three or four year courses – that information is pretty hard to stomach. 

Perhaps it is because this comparison was so close for me; forced into a gap year after a couple of missed marks deprived me of a reassuring £3465 per year university place, all I can ever do is think how much those few marks have cost me. 
For me, university was always the only choice – when I missed the grades and found myself in a gap year, there was no sit down game change talks or hours spent applying for jobs to ‘consider my options’, it was simply a case of getting back on the computer to start the UCAS process again. 

But what has changed is how I approach university. I experience university through my friends on my year off, the various facebook pictures of fancy dress and UV paint, which was made even more real on the trips I made to visit them. But when it came to my own turn to get to university, I couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable going out when I knew I had a deadline. 
The old favourite mantra “but it’s first year, it doesn’t count” became all too hollow to me when I received another student finance statement telling me that they had paid for another chunk of what was becoming my growing debt. 

Unlike my second year friends who spent hours sat in bed watching re-runs of Friends or entire tv series in one day, I found myself feeling the need to fill any spare times with productive activities – after all unless I secure a good job, this £27,000 worth of debt is here for the long term.
